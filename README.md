# Hai Sa Fim Cetateni Model

This website was part of a bigger project I founded together with a classmate to promote civics education in Romania. We also started a related club in our high school and organized a visit to the house of Parliament in Bucharest in which over 50 students participated.

I was in charge of designing and building the website, while my collaborators wrote the articles. The website contains articles organized in a hierarchy, in markdown format, which can be easily searched using the side bar or a search bar I implemented.

I built the front end using React and TypeScript, and the articles are stored using Netlify CMS, which I chose because it provides an easy interface for editing and adding/removing posts, which was important since I was collaborating with people who were not programmers.
